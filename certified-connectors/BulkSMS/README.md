### Fields
| Name | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| Auto-Unicode (required) | When `Yes`, messages are automatically sent as Unicode. Unicode message parts allow 70 characters. Standard messages allow 160 characters. If `No`, then Unicode characters are substituted by the mobile network. This may result in `?` substitutions.  |
| to | The destination mobile / cell number. Numbers must begin with a country code (eg. 1 for US. 44 for UK) and must be numeric with no spaces.  Valid example : `1234567890`, Invalid example: `(0123)456-7890`. Multiple numbers can be comma seperated with a maximum of 30,000 numbers / message parts. |
| body (required) | The message content. For example `Hello World`. Standard messages allow 160 characters per message part. Unicode messages allow 70 characters per message part. If message length is exceeded, then messages will automatically be concatened to a maximum of `longMessageMaxParts` message parts. |
| longMessageMaxParts | See `body` above for additional information. Each message part costs the same as one SMS. Concatenation reduces each message part by 7 characters. For example, a message of 161 characters will use 2 message parts and allow a total of 153 + 153 characters (thus 306 characters) |
| from | This is the `Sender ID` field. When left blank, the message will be sent from a reply pool of numbers or a shortcode, depending on region. If the message is from a reply number, then reply messages are routed back to the Inbox of your BUlkSMS account. Additonal Webhooks and other triggers can be configured from your BulkSMS account (see **Settings / Message / Replies** and **Settings / Advanced / Webhooks**. You may specify a custom sender ID in this field, but you must first have this sender ID registered and added to your BulkSMS account. See **Settings / Message / Sender IDs**  |
